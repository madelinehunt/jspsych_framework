#### General: ####
- [ ] define which add'l scripts to load in index.html
- - [ ] including any add'l plugins you want to use
- [ ] change basic variables in main.js
- [ ] define add'l defaults in defaults.js
- [ ] update local_counterbalancing() function in functions.js if needed
- [ ] update save_data_and_debrief() in functions.js if needed
- [ ] add custom variables for your experiment (e.g. randomized survey questions, # of main task trials, etc.)

#### timeline.js: ####
- [ ] update intro_timeline() as needed
- [ ] update demo_timeline() as needed
- [ ] update counter_and_debrief_timeline() as needed
- [ ] Add new timeline blocks
- [ ] Update `define_full_timeline()` and `define_testing_timeline()` with new experiment blocks


#### Helpful notes: ####
* In general, everything but timeline.js *should* be "set-it-and-forget-it". Timeline.js is where you'll do most of the actual work of setting up the experiment.
